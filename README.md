# 🚀 Wingman Codes to the Rescue!

🚀 Wingman #1: HotCold Colormap – Contrast Like Never Before! 🔥🧊
Tired of bland heatmaps that look like they were designed by a sloth? Enter the HotCold wingman, a custom colormap that slaps red-hot vibes into the warm zones and icy blue chills into the cold ones. Smooth gradient from fire (red/orange) to frost (cyan/blue), with yellow as the glow-up midpoint.
Perfect for data viz that pops without the eye strain. No cap, this'll make your plots go viral in the lab. 📈✨
